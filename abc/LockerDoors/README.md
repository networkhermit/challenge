# Locker Doors

## Description

```
    There are n lockers in a hallway, numbered sequentially from 1 to n.
Initially, all the locker doors are closed. You make n passes by the lockers,
each time starting with locker #1. On the ith pass, i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n, you
toggle the door of every ith locker: if the door is closed, you open it; if it
is open, you close it. After the last pass, which locker doors are open and
which are closed? How many of them are open?
